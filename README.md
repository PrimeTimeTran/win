# Loi Van Tran's Portfolio page for Software Development
A demonstration of some of the projects I've worked on and things I've learned in my time as a software developer.

I hope that by examining the content of this repository that the reader will find that I'm careful, deliberate, & take a lot of pride in my work

## Exercises Folder
##### Ruby Intro:
This folder contains some coding challenges that I received during my application process to [AppAcademy](https://www.appacademy.io/). Inside of the [coding_challenges_1](./exercises/coding_challenges_1) folder you'll find the coding exercises. There are also tests which will ensure the method's return the appropriate values, followed directions.

The process of writing these methods which do varying things gave me a really good introduction to Ruby as a programming language. I learned a lot about the **syntax**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, & the *nuances of Ruby* as a programming language

I've gone over the methods periodically and refactored the code in order to make it **cleaner**.

I hope that by sharing these exercises with others they can **learn Ruby themselves** or get a feel for **how comfortable I am** with the language.
